Following up on my Read Replica Database Service implementation, I have added a comprehensive CLI testing suite that puts the entire system through its paces!

-> The CLI Testing includes:

→ Health checks for master and all replicas
→ Read/write operation validation with load balancing
→ Replication strategy testing (sync & async)
→ Automatic failover simulation
→ High-load concurrent stress testing
→ System overload detection with scaling recommendations

After using the CLI to test the application to its limits, it becomes clear that sharding and partitioning are the natural next steps to overcome read-replica bottlenecks

I am currently implementing:
→ Horizontal Database Sharding (partition data across multiple nodes)
→ Sharded Read Replicas (replicas for each shard)
→ Smart Query Routing (automatically route queries to correct shard)

This will demonstrate the complete evolution: Single DB → Read Replicas → Sharded Architecture with Replicas
