# ACID-Demo: Relational Database Transactions in Action ðŸ§ª

This project is a hands-on TypeScript implementation to demonstrate the **ACID** properties of relational databases using **PostgreSQL**. It's part of the larger [Infra-Crafter](https://github.com/swataswayam-14/Infra-Crafter)
---

## ðŸ§± What Are ACID Properties?

ACID stands for:
- **Atomicity** â€” All steps in a transaction succeed or none do.
- **Consistency** â€” Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation** â€” Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability** â€” Once a transaction commits, it remains, even during system crashes.
